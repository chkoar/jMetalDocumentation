## Requirements
jMetal is implemented in Java. Since version 5.2, we are using features of Java 8, so a Java 8 JDK is required to compile the project. 

As jMetal is a Maven project, this tool is also a requirement to compile, test and package the code.

Optionally, R and Latex are needed if you use the code to carry out experimental studies to run the R scripts and compile the Latex files that will be generated.
